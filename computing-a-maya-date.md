##Introduction
Contrary to our calendar-system, which is really tied to the length of the solar year, the Mayan calendar was twofold: counting days linear from a (mythological) zero point onwards in the **Long Count**, and cyclical with the **Calendar Round**; comprised of the 260 days counting **Tzolk'in** (sacred)- and the 365 days counting **Haab'** (secular) calendar (Kettunen & Helmke, 2010). 

##Calendrical systems
Ever since time immemorial humans had the need to pinpoint the happening of an event on a specific moment in time, or record the distance between two individual events over a greater period of time. Following the course of the sun and the moon is the most essential form of timekeeping and the organisation of these perpetuate day/night cycles resulted in the first forms of calendars in the Bronze Age by the Egyptian- and Sumerians in the Ancient Near East. The constant refinement of these different calendrical systems (based on astronomical observations) resulted in various of each other-derived calendars up until 46 BC when Julian Cesar reformed the calendar to the **Julian Calendar**.

The Julian calender originated as a Roman calendar, which spread throughout most of the Christian world and was, in the course of the 16th to the 20th century, gradually substituted by the **Gregorian calendar**, because the Julian calendar was each year a few minutes behind on the solar year. The Gregorian calendar became in effect on October 15, 1582. To cover dates before that day, the **Proleptic Gregorian calendar** is produced by extending the Gregorian calendar backwards to dates preceding its official introduction. 

The Proleptic Gregorian Calendar, however, only renders identical dates with the Julian calendar between March 1, 200 AD and February 28, 300 AD. Traversing backwards from that period until 4713 BC, 38 leap-years are missing on the Proleptic Gregorian calendar which do appear on the Julian calendar. So a particular day on the Gregorian calendar in that early era is 28 days prior to that day in the Julian calendar (Steel, 2001). 

The ISO 8601 norm, which applies to representations and formats of dates in the Gregorian (and potentially proleptic Gregorian) calendar, however states the following:

> Earlier dates, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar, may be used by mutual agreement of the partners exchanging information. The standard states that every date must be consecutive, so usage of the Julian calendar would be contrary to the standard (because at the switchover date, the dates would not be consecutive)

So when the first steps were made to realign the Julian calendar to the solar year (in 46 BC, by making the year 445 days long) the Julian calendar became discontinuous, hence the Proleptic Gregorian calendar is used for dates before October 15, 1582 and the Gregorian calendar for dates after.

##The Maya calendar
Simultaneously with these earlier global attempts to organise time, the ancient Maya in the dense jungles of Central America developed a complete script and were the inventors of the Mesoamerican calendar somewhere in the early parts of the last century of the Pre-Classic period (1800 BC - AD 250). The Maya calendar actually is a conjunction of other calendrical systems and is still in use in the Guatemalan highlands and some parts of South-East Mexico. The calendar consists of several cycles (consecutive day counts) of different lengths. The **Calendar Round** is composed of the 260-day  **Tzolk'in** and the 365-day counting **Haab'** calendar and spans a period of 52 years. To measure greater periods of time, the **Long Count** is initiated as a combination of the 144.000-day B'ak'tun, 7200-day K'atun, 360-day Tun, 20-day Winal and 1-day Kin cycles.

###Tzolk'in
The perpetuate Tzolk'in calendar combines twenty day names with thirteen day numbers to produce 260 unique days. It is used to determine the time of religious and ceremonial events and formed the basis for other measures of time of great astronomical significance. For example, a double Tzolk'in (520 days) equates almost exactly with three eclipse half- years (519.93 days) and therefore provided a means for predicting solar eclipses (Malmström, 1973).

Each successive day of the Tzolk'in calendar is numbered from 1 to 13 after which the counting starts back at 1. Separately from this, every day is given a name in sequence from a list of 20 day names. So a typical count would be *1 Imix'*, *2 Ik'*, *3 Ak'b'al*, etc. up to *13 B'en* when the day numbers start back at one and the named-day sequence continues with *1 Ix*, *2 Men*, *3 K'ib'*, *4 Kab'an*, *5 Etz'nab'*, *6 Kawak*, and *7 Ajaw*. With now all the twenty named-days used, these start to repeat the cycle while the number-sequence continues with *8 Imix'*, *9 Ik'*, *10 Ak'b'al* etc. (Kettunen & Helmke, 2010).

*Figure 1: Table of the Tzolk'in count*

###Haab'
The Haab' calendar is made up of eighteen named-months of twenty days each plus an additional month of five nameless days at the end of the year, known as *Wayeb'*. The Haab' doesn't take the extra quarter-day it takes the Earth to revolve around the sun in account, like we do with an intercalary day every four year in February. Although the Maya were very well aware their calendar wasn't synchrone to the solar year, they did not change it (Coe, 2011).

Just like the Tzolk'in, each named-day in the Haab' cycle is accompanied by a numeric coefficient, being the month number. The month numbers, however, do not add up on the same cyclical way as in the Tzolk'in. The Maya attached considerable significance to the completion of time periods. As a certain month ended, the next one was treated as 'seated', indicated with a special glyph for the completion of the previous and beginning of the following month, which is usually regarded as day 0. Since it has been assumed that in designating the days of a month the Maya counted only elapsed time. Therefore, as the first day of Pop was not yet concluded, it could not be called 1 Pop. Of that month the first day of the year was *0 Pop* (the seating of Pop), followed by *1 Pop*, *2 Pop* until *19 Pop* and then continue with *0 Wo'*. This might imply that 0 Wo is the first day of the month Wo, but it actually is the last day of the month Pop. (Harris & Stearns, 2010 and Thompson, 1950).

###Calendar Round
A Calendar Round, the Mesoamerican equivalent of our century, is a notation that gives both the Tzolk'in and Haab' and can pinpoint an event over a greater period of time. Any date will continuously repeat after 18.980 days so when an identical date recurs on the calendar it is known as a Calendar Round completion and 52 years have passed (Thompson, 1950).

The Tzolk'in and Haab' calendar were aligned in this greater cycle by combining the Tzolk'in day *4 Ajaw* with the Haab' *8 Kumk'u*. The resulting date of *4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u* is associated with the creation of the the world in which the Maya lived, so any day in this 52 year cycle is completely specified by both its Tzolk'in and Haab' designations (Harris & Stearns, 2010). 

The period of a full Calendar Round (`CR`) completion is established by calculating the Least Common Multiple (`LCM`) of both the Tzolk'in (`Ft`) and Haab' (`Fh`) date. This can be done by factoring both numbers and calculating the Least Common Multiple.

	CR  = LCM(Ft,Fh)
	Ft  = 2 2 5 13
	Fh  =     5    73
	LCM = 2 * 2 * 5 * 13 * 73
	CR  = 18.980

According to Harris & Sterns (2010), because the Tzolk'in and Haab' have a common factor (5), not every combination of the two can occur on a full Calendar Round completion. Certain day names will always occur with the same group of month numbers, as illustrated in Figure 3.

| If the day name is | Then the month number must be |
|----------|--------------|
| Imix', Kimi, Chuwen or K'ib' | 4, 9, 14 or 19 |
| Ik', Manik', Eb', Kab'an | 0, 5, 10 or 15 |
| Ak'b'al, Lamat, B'en, Etz'nab' | 1, 6, 11 or 16 |
| K'an, Muluk, Ix, Kawak | 2, 7, 12 or 17 |
| Chickchan, Ok, Men, Ajaw | 3, 8, 13 or 18 |

*Figure 3: Possible month numbers by day name*

###Long Count
Since the Calendar Round only covers a period of 52 years, a more refined method of dating was needed to specify dates over greater periods, hence the Long Count is initiated. The Long Count is a perpetuate cycle that represents a linear count of days from a mythological point in prehistoric time. Long Count dates are written out as five numbers separated by four periods, such as 13.0.0.0.0 with the following syntax:

	    13     .     0     .   0   .    0    .   0
	B'ak'tun       Ka'tun     Tun     Winal     K'in

Contrary to our Western base-10 numbering, the Long Count counts in a modified base-20 scheme as the Winal unit resets after only counting to 17. The K'in, Tun, Ka'tun and B'ak'tun all start at 0 and end with 19 when the next position will pick up the counting. So one day after 12.0.0.0.19 would become 12.0.0.1.0. Each Winal is thus a block of 20 k'in and a cycle of 18 Winals represent 1 Tun. So on e day after 12.0.0.17.19 would be 12.0.1.0.0 when the Tun takes over and continues base-20. So on day after 12.0.19.17.19 would be 12.1.0.0.0 and one day after 12.19.19.17.19 would be 13.0.0.0.0. (Thompson, 1950).

Harris & Stearns (2010) state that there are only 13 cycles for the B'ak'tun and that one day after 13.0.0.0.0 the date will be notated as 0.0.0.0.1 and thus a new era is created. Other sources like Thompson (1950) don't mention the creation of a new area and continue counting as 13.0.0.0.1. Apparently this is a debatable issue, because various researchers (Thompson (1960), Grofe (2007) and Martin (2012)) appoint counting units of higher order than B'ak'tun, mentioned in figure 4.

####Table of the Long Count units 
| Long Count unit | Long Count period | Days | Approximate Solar Years |
|-----------------|-------------------|:-----|:------------------------|
| 1 K'in |  | 1 |  |	 
| 1 Winal | 20 K'in | 20 |  |
| 1 Tun | 18 Winal <sup>*(base-20 exception)*</sup> | 360 | 1 |
| 1 Ka'tun | 20 Tun | 7.200 | 20 |
| 1 B'ak'tun | 20 Ka'tun | 144.000 | 394 |
| 1 PikTun | 20 B'ak'tun | 2.880.000 | 7.885 |
| 1 KalabTun | 20 PikTun | 57.600.000 | 157.704 |
| 1 K'inchilTun | 20 KalabTun	 | 1.152.000.000 | 3.154.071 |
| 1 AlauTun | 20 K'inchilTun | 23.040.000.000 | 63.081.429 |

##Notation
Maya date notation come in various forms, but are mostly carved in a two-column grid layout divided over the 5 row spanning Initial Series and a variable row spanning Supplementary Series. Each grid column contains a designated glyph that represent either a date of a cycle mentioned above, a deity or astronomical information. Date notation in the Initial series consist of a combination between a numeral representation with a glyph for the position in the date cycle. Mesoamerican numerals are written out as a dot for 1, a bar for 5 and a shell glyph to represent the zero concept, see figure 5 (Kettunen & Helmke, 2010).

![Mesoamerican numerals](Glyphs/Numerals/mesoamerican-numerals.svg =490x352)

*Figure 5: Mesoamerican numerals*

###Initial- and Supplementary series
According to Coe (2012) most Classic inscriptions begin with the Initial Series, composed of a Long Count date and a day and month notation in the Calendar Round. Between the day and the month inscription usually a group of other glyphs occur that form the Supplementary Series (SS) and present lunar data for the particular day of the Initial Series: the number of days since the last New Moon, the position of that particular lunation in a cycle of six months and whether the lunar month contained 29 or 30 days. Findings in Copán showed that astronomers calculated a formula that held 149 moons to be equal with 4.400 days (which corresponds with 29.53020 days in our terms, only 33 seconds of its own value).

####Initial Series Introductory Glyph
The Initial Series Introductory Glyph is, most of the times, an oversized glyph spanning two glyph blocks in notation, see figure 5. Each ISIG has an unique, variable glyph within it that is framed by two comb-like elements. This glyph is indicated as the 'patron of the month' and can be used, in the absence of a Haab' glyph in the IS, used to determine the Haab' month by this patron (Harris & Stearns, 2010).

####Lords of the night
The nine lords of the underworld, in Maya religion, are a set of nine gods who each ruled over every ninth night forming a  never-ending perpetual calendrical cycle. The names of these gods are unknown, but the glyphs corresponding to these deities are well-known, and were worked out by Thompson (Thompson, 1929). In the absence of proper names, these lords of the underworld were assigned G designations. G Glyphs are usually the very first glyphs seen on monuments after the Haab', and form a continuous 9-day cycle (Coe, 2012).

##Calculation Methods
A fundamental problems when working with offset dates on our calendrical system is the, so-called, correlation problem: computing an exact date that is defined in both the the Mayan and the Gregorian calendar, thus allowing the Western date to be aligned with its Mayan equivalent and vice versa. 

###Correlation problem
At this moment there is no full-proof method to exactly align a date on the Western calendar with its Mayan equivalent. According toe Coe (2011) there are currently two methods which comply with most of the conditions to stand a change: the 11.16 (Goodman-Martinez-Thompson, GMT) and 12.9 (Spinden) correlation. To illustrate, the last one would make all the Mayan dates 260 years earlier than the former. 

Numerous scholars have suggested different correlation values, but according to Coe (2011) the most accepted value for the correlation number is that of 584.283 days as proposed in the GMT correlation, published by Thompson (1950). Radiocarbon dating of survived sapodilla wood beams from Tikal, by the University of Pennsylvania, provides overwhelming support for the GMT correlation. Also, in breaking the Maya code, Coe (2012) states "*In spite of oceans of ink that have been spilled on the subject, there now is not the slightest chance that these three scholars (conflated to GMT when talking about the correlation) were not right*". The GMT correlation agrees more closely with the archaeological and inscriptional data found. The correlation has been refined to such a point that there is, today, agreement within a three day range. 

According to Harris & Stearns (2010) archeologists and epigraphers are about evenly split on using the GMT correlation constant of 584.283 and 584.285 days. According to Barnhart (n.d.) the GMT+2 correlation gained popularity amongst scholars "*because certain carved monuments with astronomical data (such as the solar eclipse recorded on a stela from Poco Uinic in Chiapas) correlate better with two days after the original GMT*". The modern Maya in Guatemala however follow the traditional GMT. Out of respect for the living tradition i tend to follow the original GMT correlation constant of 584.283 days.

###Compute a Calendar Round for a given Long Count
According to Harris & Stearns (2010) the process of computing a Calendar Round for a given Long Count involves determining the amount of days that elapsed between a certain base date and the given Long Count. A complete date consists of four components: 1) Tzolk'in day name, 2) Tzolk'in day number, 3) Haab' month name and 4) Haab' month number that need to be derived from the given Long Count. 

The first thing that can easily be found is the day name. Because there are twenty day names and twenty coefficients for the K'in position, a K'in coefficient always matches a specific day name as mentioned in figure 1. 

The next thing to be found is the day number that matches the day name to complete the Tzolk'in. Figure 6 shows Calendar Round dates for several B'ak'tun completions (Harris & Stearns, 2010).

| Base date | Calendar Round |
|-----------|----------------|
| 7.0.0.0.0 | 10 Ajaw 18 Zak |
| 8.0.0.0.0 | 9 Ajaw 3 Sip |
| 9.0.0.0.0 | 8 Ajaw 13 Keh |
| 10.0.0.0.0 | 7 Ajaw 18 Sip |
| 11.0.0.0.0 | 6 Ajaw 8 Mak |
| 12.0.0.0.0 | 5 Ajaw 13 Sotz' |
| 13.0.0.0.0 | 4 Ajaw 8 Kamk'u |

*Figure 6: Base dates with Calendar Round coefficients*

The value of the previous base date for the given Long Count in figure 6 must be subtracted from the Long Count to find the differences (`D`) in the Long Count positions. These differences result in a starting point to exactly calculate the elapsed days in the cycle. The result for each Long Count coefficient must be multiplied by the matching days from figure 4 and then divided by 13 (Tzolk'in day numbers, `Rt`) and 365 (a full Haab' completion, `Rh`) to determine the resulting remainders of the two sets by the modulo operator.

![Tzolk'in remainders](Equations/tzolkin-remainders.svg)

![Haab remainders](Equations/haab-remainders.svg)

From the Calendar Round of the base date in figure 6, the full Tzolk'in notation can be completed by adding the value of the `Rt` variable to the Tzolk'in base date value. This value is the amount of elapsed days in the Tzolk'in cycle. If this value is above 13, it must be divided by 13 so the remainder of this calculation will be the Tzolk'in day number.

The Haab' can be computed by finding the base date in the Haab' cycle in figure 2 and multiply the numerical equivalent from that column by 20. Add the numeric Haab' equivalent from the base date to this number to find the total amount of days in the cycle. From the `Rh` variable it is known that the Haab' cycle has increased with another `n` amount of days so adding these values result in the total days that have passed. As with the Tzolk'in, if this value transcends the 365-day cycle the result must be divided by 365 so the remainder of this calculation can be used to find the Haab' date in figure 2 (Harris & Stearns, 2010).

###Compute a set of Long Counts for a given Calendar Round
Harris & Stearns (2010) created a Tun Ending table that can be used to compute a set of Long Counts for a given Calendar Round. The Tun Ending table, Appendix H in the book, is comprised of 13 columns with entry pairs in each cell and one additional column to the right (as illustrated in figure 7) that determine the day number on which the Tun ends. As mentioned in figure 3, there is a relation between the day name and month number in a Calendar Round cycle. This can be inferred from the rightmost column where the day number is not contained. Possibilities for the day number can be found in the adjoining column pairs. The first column is a shorthand a full Long Count (8.1.15.0.0 in the case of figure 7) and the right entry indicates the day number of the Calendar Round for the Long Count (15 in the case of figure 7). On the next row, the left entry displays the next Tun completion after the one in the column above (8.1.16.0.0 in the case of figure 7).

| | | |
|-|-|-|
| 8.1.15 | 12 | Ajaw 13 Keh |
|    .16 | 8 | Ajaw 8 Keh |
|    .17 | 4 | Ajaw 3 Keh |

*Figure 7: Small example of the Tun Ending Table from Harris & Stearns (2010)*

Tuns end on Calendar Rounds having Ajaw dates, hence the number of in- or decremental steps to the closest Ajaw date (for a Calendar Round that is not an Ajaw) form the initial position for further calculations. To find the Long Count, traverse forward or backward from the given Calendar Round to the closest Ajaw date and subtract this `n` days from both the Tzolk'in and Haab' (Harris & Stearns, 2010). 

Consider *12 Lamat 16 Yaxk'in* as the Calendar Round to compute the set of Long Counts for. The closest Ajaw from Lamat can be found by traversing 8 steps backward (see figure 1). 8 days before 12 Lamat is **4 Ajaw**. The same can be applied to the Haab' position. 8 days before 16 Yaxk'in is **8 Yaxk'in**. Using the Tun Ending Table backwards, the Long Count 9.15.13.0.0 can be found as matching to the Calendar Round. The 8 steps that were traversed backwards to find the closest Ajaw need to be added to the Long Count so the result will become **9.15.13.0.8**.

####Distance numbers
Since the Maya calendar is cyclical, the computed Long Count is just one out of many options. On every Calendar Round completion the given Calendar Round reoccurs with a new Long Count equivalent. To *precisely* compute a Long Count, a timeframe is required. Based on this reference point the Calendar Round completions need to be subtracted or added to come within the range of the reference point. Since each Calendar Round cycle repeats itself after 18.900 days, this number must be converted to a Long Count notation. For 1 CR this will be:

| 1 completion | 2 completions | 10 completions |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| - | - | 189800/14400 = 1 `R`45800 |
| 18980/7200 = 2 `R`4580 | 37960/7200 = 5 `R`1960 | 45800/7200 = 6 `R`2600 |
| 4500/360 = 12 `R`260 | 1960/360 = 5 `R`160 | 2600/360 = 7 `R`80 |
| 260/20 = 13 `R`0 | 160/20 = 8 `R`0 | 80/2 = 4 `R`0 |
| 2.12.13.0 | 5.5.8.0 | 1.6.7.4.0 |

*Figure 8: Example of Distance Number calculations for Calendar Round completions*

According to Harris & Stearns (2010) a Distance Number notation is a reversed order of that used in the Long Count, so a Distance number starts with the K'in coefficient. Contrary to the (almost) always five positions in the Long Count, a Distance Number only contains what is required to represent the count of days. The Distance Number for the completion of one Calendar Round will thus be **0.13.12.2**.

###Aligning the Long Count to the Gregorian calendar
To align the two calendrical systems, a certain date must be pinpointed on both the Long Count and the Gregorian calendar, hence the elaboration of days since a predefined zero point is required. The Long Count represents a linear count of days from August 11, 3114 BC while astronomers date celestial events using the Julian Day Number: a lineair count of days since a new year's day 4713 BC. To overcome this gap in time, the correlation coefficient needs to be added or subtracted from the JDN to align both calendars (Harris & Stearns, 2010).

####Compute a date on the Gregorian calendar from a Long Count
According to Sharer & Morley (1994), computing a Gregorian date for a given Long Count (`LC`) can be done by adding the correlation coefficient to the amount of days since the mythical starting point of the Maya calendar. To convert the Long Count to a more workable format, the notation must be multiplied out to find the Maya Day Number (`MDN`) with the formula

	MDN = LC[0]*144.000 + LC[1]*7.200 + LC[2]*360 + LC[3]*20 + LC[4]*1

This resulting integer is the amount of days since the mythical creation of the world on 4 Ajaw 8 Kamk'u 13.0.0.0.0 and when the correlation coefficient is added it results in the Julian Day Number (`JDN`). However, in the Gregorian (contrary to the Mayan) calendar every four year one leap day is added. From the computed Julian day number the nearest *smaller* Julian day number for which a Gregorian date is given in figure 9 need to be subtracted to find the amount of days to derive the missing leap days from. Divide this integer by 365 to find the years, the remainder will be the amount of elapsed days in the year. Divide the years by 4 to find the missing leap days. These missing leap days must then be subtracted from the elapsed days in the year to arrive at the exact day on the Gregorian calendar.

| Year | JDN | | Year | JDN | | Year | JDN |
|------|-----|-|------|-----|-|------|-----|
| 1 | 1.721.060 | | 700 | 1.976.730 | | 1400 | 2.232.400 |
| 100 | 1.757.585 | | 800 | 2.013.254 | | 1500 | 2.268.924 |
| 200 | 1.794.109 | | 900 | 2.049.779 | | 1600 | 2.305.448 |
| 300 | 1.830.633 | | 1000 | 2.086.203 | | 1700 | 2.341.973 |
| 400 | 1.867.157 | | 1100 | 2.122.827 | | 1800 | 2.378.497 |
| 500 | 1.903.682 | | 1200 | 2.159.351 | | 1900 | 2.415.021 |
| 600 | 1.940.206 | | 1300 | 2.195.876 | | 2000 | 2.451.545 |

####Compute a Long Count from a date on the Gregorian calendar
Computing a set of Long Counts for a given date on the Gregorian calendar revolves around the Julian Day Number (`JDN`). This number is the amount of consecutive elapsed days since January 1st 4713 BC, *midday* as measured on the Greenwich meridian. Since the Julian date is based on a midday measurement, each new Julian day begins at 12:00 UT time hence the outcome of a Julian Date might contain a decimal, dependant of the time of measurement (Duffett-Smith, 1989). 

To calculate the Julian date, the number of elapsed days since the beginning of the given year (`N`) and the missing leap days (`Ld`) need to be computed. First determine if the given year (`Y`) is a leap-year by checking if `Y` is evenly divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also evenly divisible by 400. Because leap-years consist of 366, contrary to the regular 365, days, the multiplier of the second integer will either be 1 for leap years or 2 for none-leap years. Then, the formulas below can be used to compute the day number and leap days. The expression `int` refers to the integer part of the number within the subsequent brackets (Scott Birney & González, 2006).

![Day number in a given year](Equations/day-number-in-year.svg)

![Leap days](Equations/leap-days.svg)

Note that, according to Duffett-Smith (1989), on many computers and calculators `int` refers to the least-integer function and render -4 for `int(-3.842)` while the value should be -3. To overcome this inconvenience the integer part of the positive equivalent should be computed and placed after a negative sign in the formula.

With these variables in place the Julian day number at 0:00 UT time for a given date can be calculated with the formula `JDN = 2.451.544,5 + 365 * (Y - 2000) + N - Ld`. To precisely calculate the day, the decimal fraction of the day at the given Universal time should be added (Scott Birney & González, 2006).

Finally subtract the correlation coefficient from the calculated Julian day number to yield the Maya day number. Divide out the Maya date number against the Long Count units in figure 3 to generate the Long Count value of a given date on the Gregorian calendar.

###Lord of the night
The mathematics of Glyph G are straightforward and based on the last two digits of a long count. Convert the K'in and Winal positions to a decimal number and add these up to find the period in days. Divide these days by 9 and multiply the remainder by 9 to find the ruling Lord of the Night after rounding the outcome up (Johnson, 2014).
